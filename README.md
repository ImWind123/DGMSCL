DGMSCL: A Dynamic Graph Mixed Supervised Contrastive Learning approach for Class Imbalanced Multivariate Time Series Classification

This code implements the DGMSCL. We use Python 3.9 to implement the proposed method, and all experiments are run on the machine of Windows system. 
To run the model, you need to put the dataset file in the data/.pt, set the necessary hyperparameters, and run the python file train.py.

All the datasets are available at the folder convertCode.
